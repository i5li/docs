# 🔐 Strict Delivery User Access Enforcement

## Overview

This page documents the implementation of **ZERO TOLERANCE access control** for delivery users in our Laravel-based multi-tenant system. The enforcement ensures that delivery users are strictly confined to a subset of frontend views (`/public/association/delivery/*`) and cannot access any unauthorized routes.

---

## 1. 🎯 Objective

Enforce strict access control over delivery users:
- ✅ Restrict all access to `/public/association/delivery/**`
- 🚫 Deny access to any other route in the application
- 🔄 Automatically redirect unauthorized delivery users

---

## 2. 🔒 Middleware: `EnforceDeliveryAccess`

> **Location:** `app/Http/Middleware/EnforceDeliveryAccess.php`

### Description
Critical security middleware that checks:
- Logged-in user has role `delivery`
- Path starts with allowed delivery URLs
- Otherwise, the user is redirected to their dashboard

```php
// Allowed delivery-only paths
$allowedPaths = [
    "/a/{$associationSlug}/delivery",
    "/a/{$associationSlug}/delivery/home",
    "/a/{$associationSlug}/delivery/statistics",
    ...
];
